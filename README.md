# Exhibition Client Source

### Why is this repository public?

This repository was made public due to the client no longer being developed or maintained. It is provided for educational and archival purposes only.

I am not sure if every update is included in between the commits. Most notable changes are included, but there may be some missing.

### Final Note

It has been fun working on this project since 2016 after numerous Lucid/Crest/Virtue 5.5 skidded clients. Triton was the first client, Crest leak based, that I started to make my own features for. From recreating Trendy jump, jump pot, and having Friendly/Lynch help explain and fix 4 damage durability for my tick aura remake. After KitPvP servers like VeltPvP started to die off due to EULA, the next NCP server to target was the Pixel.

One of my biggest regrets was neglecting the client for so long from 2018-2019. I had a lot of plans for the client, but I was too busy with school and work to continue development. I hope that this repository can serve as a reminder of what could have been and inspire others to continue working on their own projects.

The Pit was another regret I had. Many great features were planned and I should have made more pit features earlier in the development of the client.

Some of my personal favorite features were the visuals, adaptive target strafe, client smoothness after fixing ground offset crits, and during the "Disabler" period being able to significantly reduce aura angle flags with Reduce mode and Bypass by using illegal angles to keep the same Yaw and attack behind the player.

With so many clients coming up around the same 2019-2021 period, it was a fun time to be a part of the competition. The community that we cultivated around the client was amazing, and I am grateful for all the support we received. Many other client communities were toxic, but we kept good people around and had a lot of fun.
